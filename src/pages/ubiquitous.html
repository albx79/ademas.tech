        Gone are the days of walking around your office and campus with a laptop
        under your armpit.
        <b>Data is immaterial</b> and flies at the speed of light: why should we cage it
        in an aluminium case and slog it around like a herd of digital donkeys?
    </p>
    <h2><i class="fi-ctsxxl-network-solid"></i></h2>
    <p>
        Your data and your applications exist in a virtual space created by the local
        network of Ademas PCs.
        So, next time you need to show your colleagues something, just walk to their
        desk.
        By the time you have logged in, your application and data <b>will be there too</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        (And don't worry, our protection levels scheme will prevent you from
        accidentally showing something you shouldn't.)
    </p>
    <h2><i class="fi-ctsxxl-sign-out-solid"></i></h2>
    <p>
        Oh, and don't worry about logging out:
        just <b>walk away</b> and all your stuff will put back into the safety of the Ademas
        network.
    </p>
